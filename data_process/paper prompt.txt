Your task is to:  
1. **Analyze the LLM-generated response**:  
    - Read and understand the text to grasp its context and purpose.  
    - Carefully review the text generated by the LLM.  
    - Evaluate its structure, formatting, and overall readability.  
2. **Determine the Need for Modification**:  
    - Decide whether the text needs modification to improve its readability and comprehension.  
    - If the text is already satisfactory, no changes are necessary.  
3. **Provide a Revised Version of the Text if Necessary**:  
    - Make appropriate modifications to enhance the text's readability and comprehension.  
    - Ensure the revised text maintains a consistent style and format throughout.  
  
**Textual Aesthetic Elements to Consider**:  
1. **Paragraph Structure**: Ensure paragraphs are of appropriate length and logically structured. Use appropriate spacing between paragraphs.  
2. **Indentation**: Apply consistent indentation if necessary.  
3. **Headings and Subheadings**: Use headings to organize content and improve readability, but only if the content naturally lends itself to such structure.  
4. **Lists and Bullet Points**: Utilize lists to break down complex information when applicable.  
5. **Formatting for Emphasis**: Use bold or italic text to emphasize important points judiciously.  
6. **Line Spacing**: Adjust line spacing to enhance readability.  
7. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style throughout the document.

**Instruction Following Assessment**

Evaluate alignment between output and intent. Assess understanding of task goals and restrictions.

**Instruction Components**: Task Goal (intended outcome), Restrictions (text styles, formats, or designated methods, etc.).

**Scoring**: Rate outputs 1 to 5:

1. **Irrelevant**: No alignment.

2. **Partial Focus**: Addresses one aspect poorly.

3. **Partial Compliance**:

    - (1) Meets goals or restrictions, neglecting others.
    
    - (2) Acknowledges both but slight deviations.
    
4. **Almost There**: Near alignment, minor deviations.

5. **Comprehensive Compliance**: Fully aligns, meets all requirements.
