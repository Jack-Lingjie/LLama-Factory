  
Developing a daily habit of drawing can be challenging but with consistent practice and a few tips, it can become an enjoyable and rewarding part of your daily routine. Here are some strategies to help you develop the habit of drawing daily:  
1. Set a specific time: Allocate a specific time of the day to draw. It could be in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Make drawing a part of your daily routine.  
2. Set a specific duration: Determine the amount of time you want to spend on drawing each day. It can be as little as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. Be consistent with the duration to help build the habit.  
3. Start small and simple: Don't try to create a masterpiece every day, start with simple and easy-to-do sketches. Focus on improving your skills gradually.  
4. Use a variety of tools and mediums: Experiment with different tools like pencils, pens, markers, and different mediums like paper, canvas, or digital apps to keep your drawing practice interesting and engaging.  
5. Take breaks and rest: Taking breaks and resting after some time of drawing can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated.  
6. Challenge yourself: Set challenges like drawing objects from memory or a specific subject to improve your skills and keep your drawing practice interesting.  
7. Track your progress: Keep a record of your daily drawing practice and track your progress. This can be a source of motivation and help you see how far you've come.  
  
Remember, developing a habit takes time and patience. Stay consistent with your drawing practice, be flexible and open to trying new things, and with time, you'll develop a habit of daily drawing that brings you joy and satisfaction.
