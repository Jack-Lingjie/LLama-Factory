This process, called coking, removes the volatile components of the coal, leaving behind a porous, solid material that is rich in carbon.\\n\\nTamping coke is used in the SAF to provide a barrier between the molten iron and the refractory lining of the furnace. The coke helps to prevent the iron from reacting with the lining, which would damage the lining and shorten the life of the furnace.\\n\\nTamping coke also helps to distribute the heat evenly throughout the furnace. This is important because the iron must be heated to a very high temperature in order to melt.
