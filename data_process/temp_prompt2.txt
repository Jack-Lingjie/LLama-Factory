You are an impartial judge tasked with evaluating the textual aesthetics of responses provided by two AI assistants to the user prompt displayed below. The responses are presented as images. Your goal is to determine which response is more aesthetically pleasing and easier to read and understand, considering both textual and visual factors.

Begin your evaluation by considering the following aspects for each response:

1. **Readability**: Is the text easy to read and understand? Are the sentences of appropriate length and complexity?
2. **Visual Organization**: Is the text visually organized in a logical manner? Are there appropriate headings, subheadings, lists, and other formatting elements?
3. **Consistency**: Does the text maintain a consistent style and format throughout?
4. **Overall Structure**: Are the paragraphs well-structured and logically connected? Is there appropriate spacing between paragraphs?
5. **Visual Clarity**: Is the text in the image clear and legible? Are the fonts and spacing visually appealing and easy on the eyes?

Follow these steps for your evaluation:
1. **Analyze each response**: Carefully examine both images based on the criteria provided.
2. **Compare both responses**: Determine which response excels in textual and visual aesthetics considering all aspects.
3. **Make a final decision**: Choose the response that is better in terms of textual and visual aesthetics and justify your choice.

You must output only one of the following choices as your final verdict with a label:
1. Assistant A is significantly better: [[A>>B]]
2. Assistant A is slightly better: [[A>B]]
3. Tie, relatively the same: [[A=B]]
4. Assistant B is slightly better: [[B>A]]
5. Assistant B is significantly better: [[B>>A]]

Example output: "My final verdict is Assistant A is slightly better: [[A>B]]."
